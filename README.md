# ECG_PPG_Signal_Processing 
An investigation of any external trigger (drinking green tea) on the human body using ECG & PPG Signal through feature extraction (PAT, HR, PWV calculation)
This scripts is based on pre-processing ECG, PPG, derivatives of PPG, and find some feature extraction- pulse arrival time(PAT), pulse transit time, pulse width velocity, Heart Rate. Initially, the raw data-set is collected from different subjects using ECG sensor and ppg sensor via NI-DAQ 601. PPG, ECG were taken before and 30 mins after having an external trigger (green tea) from human hands (finger and forearms) for 1 min.
